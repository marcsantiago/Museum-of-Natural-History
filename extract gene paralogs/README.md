This script is attended to help biologist extract gene paralogs from a bast.out file.  The e value is the determining factor in whether an organism is pulled from the out file.  The taxa are are pulled are matched against a local data containing taxa (>gi taxa, dna sequence).  If the taxa id was pulled from the out file the program will match that Id to the target file and pull that id and its respective DNA with it.  This script helps with the long and tendious task of copying ans pasting all this data manually.  Mock data has been provided in order to test the script and understand more closely its function.
